This howto explains how to build 'jpylyzer' as an linux executable so that python is no longer a dependency.
This was done because there was an incompatibility between 'jpylyzer' and python version bellow 2.7.


INSTRUCTIONS

1. Download 'pyinstaller'

wget https://github.com/downloads/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/pyinstaller-1.5.1.tar.bz2

2. unplack it

tar -xjf pyinstaller-1.5.1.tar.bz2 Â 

3. compile

run './pyinstaller jpylyzer.py'

4. look in the directory 'jpylyzer/dist/jpylyzer'.

Voila!
