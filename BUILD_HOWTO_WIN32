This howto explains how to build 'jpylyzer' as a 32-bit Windows executable so that Python is no longer a dependency. Procedure described here will also pack binaries in a distribution-ready ZIP file!

This all works on Win32 systems, it will probably work on Win64 systems as well (although I haven't found a way to build actual Win64 binaries, since the build packages don't appear to support this yet).

SET-UP AND CONFIGURATION (YOU ONLY NEED TO GO THROUGH THESE STEPS ONCE):

1. Download 'pyinstaller' from http://www.pyinstaller.org/

2. unpack/unzip it with your favourite file archive manager. Note: this has to be a location where
   a user who will run the package (i.e. build the jpylyzer executable) has write access!! 

3. Run the pyinstaller configuration script ('python Configure.py')

4. Download  and install 7-zip file archiver from http://www.7-zip.org/

5. Open the batch file 'buildWin32.bat' which is part of the jpylyzer distribution, and update the 
   configuration variables ('python', 'pathPyInstaller' and 'zipCommand')

BUILDING THE WIN32 DISTRIBUTION:

1. From the jpylyzer root dir (i.e. the directory in which jpylyzer.py is installed), run the
   following batch file:

buildWin32.bat

2. Look at the zip file in the directory 'win32'.

Voila!
